# CRUDOperations
This project is a RESTful API built with Spring Boot that demonstrates full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. Unlike standard JPA, this project uses Spring JDBC (JdbcTemplate) to execute raw SQL queries, providing more control over database interactions and better performance for simple operations.
